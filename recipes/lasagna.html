        <li>500 grams of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; 
            cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. </li>
        <li>Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; 
            drain. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt, oregano, thyme, basil,
             and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper; 
             simmer 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, 
            and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover 
            the bottom in a thin layer. Form a layer atop the sauce with 3 of the 
            lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. 
            Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture 
            and then ladle about 1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese. 
            Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 
            1/4 pound of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. 
            Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
